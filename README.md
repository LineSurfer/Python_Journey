# Python_Journey

This is the start of my journey learning how to become a Python programmer.

I am currently following the course of 100 Days of Python with Dr. Angela Yu.
Hoping at the end of this course, I will be able to create a simple project of my own and share it on Github.

As of now, I am uploading all of my Daily Projects and Daily Interactive Exercise on this other two branch to keep my progress.
Feel free to comment and criticize all my work.
